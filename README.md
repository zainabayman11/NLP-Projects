# NLP-Projects

Description:
This repository contains a collection of small to medium-scale Natural Language Processing (NLP) projects. Each project focuses on a specific NLP task, such as sentiment analysis, text preprocessing, tokenization, and text classification for English and Arabic datasets. The projects are organized to demonstrate end-to-end pipelines, from raw data cleaning to model training and evaluation.

Highlights:

- Preprocessing Pipelines: Efficient handling of text cleaning, normalization, stopwords removal, tokenization, and stemming/lemmatization.

- Multilingual Support: Includes both English and Arabic NLP workflows with language-specific processing techniques.

- Machine Learning Models: Implementation of classic ML models (Logistic Regression, TF-IDF, CountVectorizer) for text classification tasks.

- Modular Project Structure: Each NLP project is self-contained, making it easy to explore, run, and extend.
