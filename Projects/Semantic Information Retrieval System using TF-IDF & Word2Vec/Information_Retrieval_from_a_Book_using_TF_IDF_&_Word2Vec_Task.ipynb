        "You will read the PDF, extract and preprocess its content, vectorize the textual data, and finally retrieve relevant information based on a user query.\n",

        "2- Objective of the Extension:\n",
        "Modify the previous TF-IDF-based retrieval system by combining TF-IDF weighting with Word2Vec embeddings. Instead of using raw TF-IDF vectors for similarity, represent each paragraph as a TF-IDF-weighted average of Word2Vec word embeddings. This allows capturing semantic similarity in addition to term importance"
